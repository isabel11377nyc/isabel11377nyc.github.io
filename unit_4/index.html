        <h2>I am on BBG (do I love it?)</h2>
        <p>I am sure by now you have heard of BBG moms. Look this up on instagram (#bbgmoms) and you will be amazed. I was perusing instagram one day and I noticed that there alot of bloggers that I follow on this program. So I started clicking around and it sounded perfect for me. Only 28 minutes a day . Check. Only 3 times a week. Check.</p>
        <p>I have been one to get obsessed wwith the gym, I even had a trainer at one point in my life and it was amazing ( and expensive) . But then I had kids and didnt want to do anything. I run 2x a week. On the weekend.. Mostly so I can stuff my face with burget king later that day. But my body was just not feeling right. I was tired and everything was touching and I just didnt feel good. Unfortunately it fortunately  I dont eat my feelings. I shop my feelings.. Not sure which is worse.</p>
        <p>So I took a before picture and I started my journey. And the first week sucked. I got up at 5am and I did the work out.. And did again and then again that week.. And I sweated and I was tired and I had aches afterwards. But then it became a routine. In fact my kids would get up and ask me if I did my exercises. And 19 weeks later.. I love it. I mean I hate it and I love it. I never want to do it. And I am always tired in the morning. But I have seen results. I am not skinny, and my jeans are tight, but in a good way. My legs are stronger, my arms are stronger. I can pick up my 3 year old no problem. When I go for my runs they are peice of cake. I would run longer distances , but I usually want to get home fast to eat. I know that if I ate better I would probably be really happy with results.. But with me, its 1 small thing at a time. Below is my routine.</p>
        <UL>
            <li>Monday - Sweat</li>
            <li>Tuesday - Rest</li>
            <li>Wed - Sweat</li>
            <li>Thursday - Sweat</li>
            <li>Friday- Rest</li>
            <li>Saturday - Challenge, Run</li>
            <li>Sunday - Run</li>
        </UL>
        <p>Now I dont always follow this, sometimes Thursday turns into Friday, or Saturday, but I have completed 3 every week for 19 weeks. And I feel great. Oh and I do these 99% of the time alone. As easy as they are, the kids want my attention and are in the way. So I really try to do these in the morning around 5 or 5:30 am. Even if someone is up with me that early they are so tired, they just sit on the couch with their ipads watching me, and telling me “You can do it.” :)</p>

        <h2>My new thing is… earrings</h2>
        <p>I was never and earrings person. I usually wore my fake studs from Nordstrom that I loved. I have always been a little self concious about my ears. They are a tad to big for my head so I think. I have never actually had anyone say this to me except my husband when he calls me and i “dont hear him” cause I am busy in my closet. :)</p>
        <!--<p>I recently got a classic lob and although i initially was not into it, i love it. And I feel like this hairstyle calls for awesome long dangly earrings. With that, i bought my first grown up hoop earrings and have not looked back. Here are a few pieces that I have just loved lately.</p> -->
